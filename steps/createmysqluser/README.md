When using the `CREATE USER` command, you need to specify a username 
followed by an `@` sign and the hostname from which the user will connect. 
If the intention is to only allow local access from your Ubuntu server, you 
can set the hostname as `localhost`. Although it is not mandatory, enclosing 
both the username and host within single quotes can be beneficial in 
preventing potential errors.
