This step will grant the MySQL user the `ALL PRIVILEGES` privilege, which 
will provide them with broad superuser privileges akin to the root user's 
privileges.

Granting extensive privileges of this nature should **not** be done casually, 
as granting access to this MySQL user would provide complete control over all 
databases on the server to anyone with access.

You can find the full list of available privileges in 
[the official MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#privileges-provided-summary).
