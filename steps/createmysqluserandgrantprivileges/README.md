After the successful installation of MySQL, a `root` user account is 
automatically created, providing you with full control over your database 
management. This `root` user has extensive privileges, granting complete 
authority over all databases, tables, and users within the MySQL server. 
However, it is advisable to limit the usage of this account solely for 
administrative tasks and avoid utilising it for other purposes. The 
following steps will guide you on how to leverage the `root` MySQL user 
to generate a new user account and assign specific privileges to it.
