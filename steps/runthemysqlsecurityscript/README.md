You will be guided through a series of prompts that allow you to customise 
the security options of your MySQL installation. The initial prompt will 
inquire whether you wish to configure the Validate Password Plugin, which 
evaluates the strength of new MySQL user passwords to ensure their validity.

Enabling the Validate Password Plugin means that any newly created MySQL 
user who authenticates with a password will be obliged to meet the password 
policy criteria you choose. The highest policy level, accessible by 
entering `2`, enforces a password length of at least eight characters and 
requires a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, 
and special characters.

If you have enabled the Validate Password Plugin, you will receive feedback 
regarding the strength of the password you have entered. Subsequently, 
the script will prompt you to confirm whether you wish to proceed with the 
current password or if you prefer to enter a different one.

At this point, you can press `Y` and then `ENTER` to accept the default 
settings for all the following questions. This action will eliminate 
anonymous users and the test database, disable remote root logins, and 
enforce the new rules, ensuring that MySQL promptly acknowledges the 
modifications you have implemented.

After the completion of the script, your MySQL installation will be secured. 
You can proceed to create a dedicated database user using the MySQL client.
