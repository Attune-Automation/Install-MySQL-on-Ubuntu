This Attune Project contains automated processes to install MySQL on Ubuntu.

MySQL is a freely available database management system that operates under 
an open-source license. It is frequently included in the widely-used LAMP 
stack, consisting of Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/Python/Perl. MySQL 
follows the relational model and relies on Structured Query Language (SQL) 
for effective data management.
